                Running a shelter incurs high and rising costs for essentials like food, utilities, and maintenance. These expenses challenge the ability to maintain a safe environment. Shelters also provide adoption programs and education on responsible pet ownership. Supporting these efforts enhances the shelter's ability to serve both animals and the community, highlighting the need for expanded services.
